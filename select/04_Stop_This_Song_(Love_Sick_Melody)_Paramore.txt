You say the sweetest things
And I can't keep my heart from singing
Along to the sound of your song
My stupid feet keep moving
To this 4/4 beat, I'm in time with you, oh-oh, oh-oh
To this 4/4 beat, I would die for you (Die for you)
(Someone stop this)

I've gone too far to come back from here
But you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me

Won't someone stop this song?
So I won't sing along
Someone stop this song
So I won't sing

I never let love in
So I could keep my heart from hurting
The longer that I live with this idea
The more I sink in
To this 4/4 beat, I'm in time with you, oh-oh, oh-oh
To this 4/4 beat, I would die for you (Let's stop this song)

I've gone too far to come back from here
But you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me
I've come too far to get over you
And you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me

Won't someone stop this song?
So I won't sing along
Someone stop this song
So I won't sing
Your lovesick melody
Is gonna get the best of me tonight
But you won't get to me
If I don't sing

It creeps in like a spider that can't be killed
Although I try and try to
Well, don't you see I'm falling?
Don't wanna love you, but I do

(Lovesick melody) Can someone stop this song?
So I won't sing along
(Lovesick melody, oh) Can someone stop this song?
So I won't sing
Your lovesick melody
Is gonna get the best of me tonight
But you won't get to me
No, you won't get to me
'Cause I won't sing
