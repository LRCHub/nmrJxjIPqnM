Normally I start to panic
Get too close, I cut apart the strings
Typically, I break bad habits
But with you it happened naturally
Told myself that love is violent
Feelings fade and bitterness proceeds
When you're closer, I don't mind it
Secretly, I want you close to me
Sick of love, I'm tired of the bullshit
Fed up with subtracting names
Need someone that isn't an equation
Only adding up to pain
But you're so
Hiding from my own emotions
Terrified of letting someone in
Just because I'm over closure
Doesn't mean I wanna start again
Trying to maintain composure
Let's pretend you're only just a friend
But if you leaned a little closer
I think you could fall into my head
Sick of love, I'm tired of the bullshit
Fed up with subtracting names
Need someone that isn't an equation
Only adding up to pain
But you're so
Sometimes the doubt outweighs the feelings
I'm never sure who I should trust
I'm getting tired of breakin' and healin'
I'm getting sick of patchin' myself up
But you got me fallin' off to the ceiling
I get so dizzy when our lips touch
I wanna run away from my feelings
I can't remember which way is up
(Sometimes the doubt outweighs the feelings)
(I'm never sure who I should trust) but with you
(I'm getting tired of breakin' and healin')
(I'm getting sick of patchin' myself up)
